This is my actual best attempt for this daily challenge. 
It doesn't work and i still don't know why.
The idea is almost right, but the implementation is not. 
This challenge is tough, like the previous ones, but i'm tired now and with only 2 days left before 
Christmas i don't think i'm going to finish the AoC 2021 in time.
At first i thought a simpler solution would have been enough, but the algorithm requires more steps and
it seems to be more complicated than i thought. 
My idea was:
Increment all cells's energy by 1, then check each cell from the top left to the bottom right of the cavern 
(aka grid/matrix), when i find a cell with an energy's value bigger than 9 then i flash it by increment all
adjacent cells's energy by 1 and label it "flashed". This solution seems to be wrong because the final
result is different from the result shown here: https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/11. [after step 1]

So...i just give up for the moment, maybe in the future i'll end this challenge. I wish a happy Christmas
to you and your family. I enjoyed this event and these challenges. 

Thanks Eric Wastl.
